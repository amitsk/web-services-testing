# Functional Testing APIs using RestAssured
This project contains examples of  functional  testing REST APIs using [RestAssured](https://github.com/jayway/rest-assured) . RestAssured is a library to simplify testing of REST APIs and provides a rich DSL. 
The manual is at [RestAssured Manual](https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/wiki/Usage)  

#Sample  API to test

Use the excellent [https://github.com/typicode/json-server](json-server). Follow the set up instructions to install it.
From `rest-api-db` run `json-server db.json`. All examples use the `todos` API.


==The API  needs to be running to run the groovy and the scala tests.==

The following examples are provided :

* Java8 using Maven and JUnit5
* Groovy with Spock & Gradle
* Scala using ScalaTest and sbt.
* Kotlin using JUnit5

Detailed instructions are in the individual READMEs

##***Happy Testing !***
